Quite often, Apache Kafka is a central part in a distributed system, maybe running in an hybrid-cloud environment.
Different services communicate each other by using Apache Kafka as en event or data streaming platform.
Not all the applications are also directly connected to Apache Kafka but they use different protocols, i.e. HTTP, and then messages are forwarded to it.
Because of the distributed nature, it is quite difficult to track how messages move around.
This is where the OpenTelemetry project comes into the picture.
